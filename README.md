# <img src="./imgs/logo.svg" width=30 height=30/> Ninja - fasten your iteration boost

(To be improved) An auxiliary tool that can automatically generate interface `contract test cases`, reducing the amount of coding for developers, improving code quality, and helping to accelerate product iterations

## What capabilities does this tool provide?
The focus of this tool is to automatically generate test cases. After the developer/tester inputs the parameters and restrictions of the interface into this tool, this tool will generate **boundaries, exceptions, and normal cases** for the interface, and combine it with [Microsoft pict tool]((https://github.com/microsoft/pict)) to generate an appropriate amount of contract test cases. This avoids excessive output due to exhaustive methods.

## Usage (Containerized deployment to be completed)
### run frontend
```
cd ninja-web
npm i
npm run dev
```
### run backend
```
cd ninjia-server
npm i
npm run start
```


## Architecture
Frontend: React.js + Antd

Backend: Express.js

Other Tools: docker, PICT

## Non-functional requirements
Our team may put emphasis on `Reliability`, `Usability`, `Maintainability`, and `Compatibility`, The specific embodiment is as follows：
> `Reliability`: Write robust code to handle errors and exceptions. Implement appropriate logging and error handling mechanisms to promptly detect and resolve issues. 

> `Usability`: Design intuitive and user-friendly interfaces to ensure users can easily interact with the tool. Provide relevant help documentation and user guides to acquaint users with the tool's features and usage.

> `Maintainability`/ `Testability`: Write clear, modular, and readable code to facilitate future maintenance and modifications. Use comments and documentation to explain code logic and design decisions. Adopt practices like test-driven development (TDD) and unit testing to ensure code quality and maintainability.

> `Compatibility`/ `portability`: Ensure compatibility across different platforms, operating systems, or browsers. Follow standards and specifications for seamless integration and interaction with other systems.
